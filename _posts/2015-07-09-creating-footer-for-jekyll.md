Updating footer to include all social links
-

I am updating this jekyll blog to a new theme. For the new theme, I had to update the footer to include links to my mail, github and twitter.

What I really wanted was to just show the relevant icons and then link them to my accounts.

Github and Twitterâ€™s SVG icons are given in the default implementation of Jekyll. Thankfully :).
The problem was with getting the mail icon.
So I had to research the internet to get the desired icon. I found [this](http://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/close-envelope_12194). Though the svg paths the file uses are not optimized (for viewing at least).

So I embarked on a run to optimize the thing so that I could include the svg directly in my footer.

Notes:

* All svg files are simple text files which have an `<svg>` HTML tag representing the icon.
* `path` and `polygon` elements are used to describe the figure inside the `svg` element.
* To merge two `path` elements, just append the `d` attribute of the second into first (not sure if this works everytime).
* `viewBox` attribute on `svg` element determines the coordinate system used by the browser to render the svg. [Learn more](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/viewBox).
* `scss` files can create variables. This is used to determine base colors once and then reused across all the css files. Found this really interesting. :)

The final looks like this:

{% highlight html linenos %}
