# Thinking Functionally

Functional programming doesn't require you to work with only a functional language. The basic rules of it can be applied to any language you use.

I took a 3 class session at Directi on the topic a few weeks back. Some of the important topics were covered, including:

* What is Functional Programming?
* What makes it possible?
* Functions as first class citizens
* Pure functions and higher order functions
* Advantages of Functional programming
* A hands on exercise using mit-scheme
* Declarative thinking and more..

The presentation used was created using remark and is in open domain at Github - [Functional Programming presentation](https://github.com/ayushgoel/presentations/tree/master/FunctionalProgramming).
