Create [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/) from terminal.

* Use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install [gist](https://github.com/defunkt/gist).

{% highlight bash %}
    brew install gist
{% endhighlight %}

* `gist --login` to give OAuth access to the application so that it can create gists on your behalf. Otherwise it creates anonymous gists.
* Now read the documentation via `gist -h` and use it according to what you want.
