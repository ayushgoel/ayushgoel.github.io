### 1. Create [Github gists](https://gist.github.com/) from terminal

* Use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install [gist](https://github.com/defunkt/gist).

{% highlight bash %}
  brew install gist
{% endhighlight %}

* `gist --login` to give OAuth access to the application so that it can create gists on your behalf. Otherwise it creates anonymous gists.
* Now read the documentation via `gist -h` and use it according to what you want.

### 2. Checking git repositories on your browser locally

Every one has faced the issue of Github not showing the complete blob diff for a file because it is too large. It asks you to see the diff on your own machine, locally.

![Github Diff too big file](/assets/github-diff-too-big-file.png)
![Github Diff too big](/assets/github-diff-too-big.png)

If you are my kind who doesn't like seeing big diffs in terminal, then this solution is for you.

Git has a hidden feature to let you browse [your repository on browser][instaweb-scm]. This command starts a local server for your repository:

    git instaweb

The issue is that there is not straight way of looking at blob diff between two specific commits.

Digging into the documentation I found that passing the correct parameters can help you see the diff.

    let SHA1 = SHA of commit to check diff from
    let SHA2 = SHA of commit to check diff to

Once we have SHA1 and SHA2 resolved,
Just create the URL like:

{% highlight HTML linenos %}
http://127.0.0.1:1234/? # Endpoint on which git is running instaweb
p=.git;
a=blobdiff;
f=file-path-to-check-diff-of;
hb=SHA1;
hpb=SHA2
{% endhighlight %}

Just open this URL in your favourite browser and you would be able to see the diff of the file.
