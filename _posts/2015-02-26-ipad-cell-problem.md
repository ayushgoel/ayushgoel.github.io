Using a [UINib]() to create a [UITableViewCell]() was one of the best convineiences I had in long time. The problem started when the `backgroundColor` set in the [UINib]() didn't take effect for iPad builds.
I had to set the `backgroundColor` explicitly in code for each cell.
Here is the relevant [commit](http://something.com).

// TODO, keep a list of all links to apple docs somewhere else.
