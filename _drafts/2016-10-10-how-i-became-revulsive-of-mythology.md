>History is written by winners

This quote has slowly crept in my mind regarding Ravana. The guy might not be very bad, but he was portrayed so. Aryans might not be so worthy as shown to us, but we will never know.

Since my childhood, I have been fascinated by all the stories from our scriptures. I used to be an avid reader of Champak/Nandan. Getting up early on Sundays to watch a string of TV serials presenting our ancient Mega stories like my habit.

I was and am and will be religious. This is not trash talk against a religion. I just want to share my thoughts on what I think hinduism as my religion is.

In recent times the religion has become tainted with views from bogus people. I have no evidence of them being theives and thus wont call them one. But the people following them are following a path I think was not designed by the people who started Hinduism as a religion.

Hinduism is a large, extremely large religion. It makes way for people who want to live in peace. It makes way for people who want to be conquerers. People who want to live a saintly life. People who want to live lavishly. People who want to follow rules, and people who break rules. People who love living people, love statues, love animals and even people who love dead bodies. This might be the vastest religion of all bringing people from all the different sects under a single umbrella.
The religion in itself demands nothing. You will find people following hinduism living across the street but following entirely different traditions.

I remember a very good quote I read somewhere, "Hinduism is a true depiction of Open Source". It made me smirk a bit at the time I read it, but as the time passed and my understanding grew, I now realize how pertinent is it to Hinduism.

"Hinduism" as a word doesn't describe a religion, it describes a region. In ancient times when River brahmaputra divided the land of India and western nations, the river was called as river "Sindhu". People on the west coast of the river would call the people living on the eastern coast and beyond as "sindhu". But these people didn't pronounce "s" as "sa", but rather as "ha". This made them pronounce "Sindhu" as "Hindu" and thus the name of all the people living across "Sindhu" became "Hindu".
So what is our religion then? From my limited knowledge of ancient texts, I have deduced it to be "Sanatan Dharam". Many of the temples in North India abide by its name.

The moral of the above story is that if a person tells me that his religion is "Hinduism", I outrightly reject any of the claims he/she has for the religion. If they do not understand even the name of the religion, how can I expect them to understand the complex scriptures our religion comes from.

Recently when I read (actually I had the audio book, so I heard) "Asura, the tales of the vanquished", I was astonished. The details that the writer brings in, really makes you wonder if the Ramayana you heard in your childhood was also some one's imagination of a war between two kings. The divinity of the characters in any epic becomes questionable. The book brings in the element of Sita being the daughter of Ravana himself, which seemed far fetched. But then, everything in the epic is far fetched anyways! What to believe then?
The main highlight of the book was the perspective of Ravana. Why did he not like Rama? Ravana looks at the culture of Aryans and how they divide themselves into sections of societies. He does not like the fact that people do not have a choice on the occupation they want to do. On top of it, women of the society are placed much lower in the hierarchy. He is unable to understand the reasons behind it (just like everybody else).
If this were the case, any sane man would side by Ravana, who is trying to protect his people from the perils that Aryan Samaj might bring in his kingdom.

So the question arises, is Ravan the good guy or the bad? I don't know.. Any answer to that question doesn't solve the question I have in my mind, "What is the purpose of life?". Ravana might be the good guy, or maybe to put it more believably, he might be a not-bad guy. But the history is written by victors, and victors get the full rights to write the story as they like.

The book also highlights the Deva community on how it gained the vast empire of northern plains and beyond in India. I did not agree to the events listed there, but in essence I have always felt that the devas listed in our scriptures were normal people.
